                An eye chart, or optotype, is a chart used to measure visual acuity. Eye charts are often used by health care professionals, such as 
                optometrists, physicians or nurses, to screen persons for vision impairment.Ophthalmologists, physicians who specialize in the eye, 
                also use eye charts to monitor the visual acuity of their patients in response to various therapies such as medications or surgery.
                The chart is placed at a standardized distance away from the person whose vision is being tested. The person then attempts to identify 
                the symbols on the chart, starting with the larger symbols and continuing with progressively smaller symbols until the person cannot identify the 
                symbols. The smallest symbols that can be reliably identified is considered the person's visual acuity.
                The Snellen chart is the most widely used. Alternative types of eye charts include the logMAR chart, Landolt C, E chart, Lea test, Golovin–Sivtsev 
                table, the Rosenbaum chart, and the Jaeger chart.

          <h4>How does an eye chart work?</h4> 
            It is a numerical reference depicting how well you can see objects from a distance of 20 feet compared to someone with a “perfect” vision looking at the same 
            object at 20 feet. This fraction of how well you see is called visual acuity. If you have poor vision and lost your glasses, your visual acuity may be 20/100.

          <h4>Top 4 eye charts used during Eye Exams</h4> 
          Most of us have experienced the nerve racking moment when the Optometrist asks you to read the letters off the eye chart. We start to second guess ourselves 
          and how “blind” we are. But just like most things in medicine, there is a method to using the eye charts. Eye charts are just one of many tools the doctor uses 
          when conducting an eye exam, but they  serve a valuable purpose when checking your vision. Eye charts are used during an eye exam to measure visual acuity by 
          checking how well you see in comparison to other people. Your eye doctor has you look at the eye chart and read the smallest line of text that you can see from 
          20 feet away. If you see clearly at 20 feet, which is what most people see at that distance, you have 20/20 vision.In the United States legal blindness is defined 
          as your best corrected vision, even when wearing glasses or contact lenses, is only 20/200.  20/200 vision means you have to get within 20 feet of the eye chart 
          to read the line that people with normal vision can see from 200 feet away.

            <h4>SNELLEN</h4> 
              The original eye chart designed in the 1860’s by the Dutch eye doctor Hermann Snellen. The first line on this chart is a giant letter E. You read the chart 
              from top to bottom, left to right covering one eye at a time.The normal Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. The first line consists of one 
              very large letter, which may be one of several letters, for example E, H, or N. Subsequent rows have increasing numbers of letters that decrease in size. A person 
              taking the test covers one eye from 6 metres or 20 feet away, and reads aloud the letters of each row, beginning at the top. The smallest row that can be read 
              accurately indicates the visual acuity in that specific eye. The symbols on an acuity chart are formally known as "optotypes".

            <h4>TUMBLING E</h4> 
            The Tumbling E eye chart is similar to the standardize Snellen eye chart that most people use for testing; however it contains a series of letter E's 
            instead of the variety of letters included in the Snellen chart. These letter E's are rotated at 90 degrees requiring the individual taking the test to 
            properly identify the direction of each version of the E's "fingers" using their hands to point up, down, right or left.The tumbling E eye chart is typically 
            used to test individuals who are unable to properly communicate or identify letters of the alphabet. This may include young children who do not know their alphabet, 
            people who are illiterate or perhaps individuals who suffer from a handicap. This test provides doctors an easy and effective means to test the visual acuity of 
            individuals who fall into any of these categories. In fact, studies have shown that the results of this test are as accurate as the standard Snellen eye chart.

            <h4>TUMBLING E</h4> 
            he Landolt C, also known as a Landolt ring, Landolt broken ring, or Japanese vision test, is an optotype: a standardized symbol used for testing vision. 
            It was developed by the Swiss-born ophthalmologist Edmund Landolt.
            The Landolt C consists of a ring that has a gap, thus looking similar to the letter C. The gap can be at various positions (usually left, right, bottom, 
            top and the 45° positions in between) and the task of the tested person is to decide on which side the gap is. The size of the C and its gap are reduced 
            until the subject makes a specified rate of errors. The minimum perceivable angle of the gap is taken as measure of the visual acuity. It is generally 
            practised in the laboratory. 
            The stroke width is ​1⁄5 of the diameter, and the gap width is the same. This is identical to the letter C from a Snellen chart. The Landolt C is the 
            standard optotype for acuity measurement in most European countries. It was standardized, together with measurement procedures, by the German DIN, as 
            DIN 58220 (now EN ISO 8596). 
            Although accepted as a 'gold standard', this optotype has its own inherent problems, possibly due to higher brain function where the gap will appear 
            closed near the limit of resolution, especially when the gap is at the 6 o'clock position.This is not due to the structure of the cornea or lens, 
            nor is it due to astigmatic errors.

            <h4>ETDRS</h4> 
            ETDRS acuity testing has become the worldwide standard for visual acuity testing, replacing the Snellen and Sloan acuity tests. ETDRS stands for Early Treatment 
            Diabetic Retinopathy Study. The ETDRS test is designed to eliminate inaccuracies in the Snellen and Sloan tests.The CSV-2000, CSV-1000 and ESV-3000 ETDRS offer 
            automated, self-calibrating standardized test lighting for ETDRS, to ensure consistent and accurate results. The CSV-2000 is a fully computerized testing system 
            which displays the ETRDS test charts on a computer monitor. The computer display light level is standardized through a patented technology called “AcQviz.” The 
            CSV-1000 offers a backlit ETDRS test and incorporates highly advanced miniature fluorescent light source technology that is standardized through automated
            calibration circuitry. The ESV-3000 is a large-format backlit ETDRS test device that incorporates advanced LED light source technology, also standardized 
            through automated calibration circuitry. In each device, the auto-calibration circuitry constantly monitors the testing light source and calibrates each to a
            test luminance of 85 cd/m2.  The ESV-3000 can also be set to calibrate to a light level of 3 cd/m2. Other ETDRS testers are not standardized as they have no 
            circuitry to control the test lighting. They employ non-standardized computer monitors or “off-the-shelf” fluorescent bulbs that require a bulb “burn-in” 
            period. For these other units, the light levels often drift or change in brightness over time and for their bulbs, as they age. they must be constantly 
            replaced. Each time a bulb is replaced, there is an additional “burn-in” period. No testing can be accomplished during the “burn-in” period.
