                <h5>What is myopia</h5>

                Nearsightedness (myopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see objects near to you clearly, but objects farther away are blurry. It occurs when the shape of your eye causes light rays to 
                bend (refract) incorrectly, focusing images in front of your retina instead of on your retina. Until recently, myopia had been viewed as an eye-focusing disorder, easily corrected with single-vision 
                spectacles. Many now agree, however, that myopia is not simply a refractive disorder, but that it is also a disease with the potential to cause permanent vision loss.

                <h5>History</h5>
                
                Aristotle may have written the first observations of myopia around 350 B.C. Because their eyeballs are too long, people with this condition can see 
                objects that are close by, but distant objects tend to look blurry. Neil Handley, a museum curator at the College of Optometrists in London, said not much is known about how people dealt with myopia 
                before the first lenses for nearsighted people were invented, in the 15th century in Europe. And he noted that "even in the history of the invention of spectacles, that is a late development."

                <h5>Is myopia epidemic </h5>
                
                The increase in the prevalence of myopia has become a major public health concern and a top priority in recent years. It is estimated that the myopia epidemic will affect half of the global population 
                by the year 2050. Today, myopia is the second most common cause of global blindness, and the negative effects that myopia can have on the ocular system are comparable to those of hypertension on the
                cardiovascular system.

            <h3>Indroduction to myopia</h3><br>
            <p>Myopia is a refractive error that allows individuals to see objects up close, while distant objects appear blurry and out of focus.  
              The reason for this focus error is the shape of the eye: as the eye develops and grows, it can become elongated or the surface of the 
              eyeball may become curved. This causes light rays to focus at a point in front of the retina, instead of directly on its surface.</p>

              <h5>Myopia with Kids</h5>
              Myopia, or nearsightedness, is one of the most common vision problems in childhood. In fact, about 9% of kids ages 5-17 are nearsighted. Kids with this condition can usually see things close up, but struggle to see things far away. It is often diagnosed around
              first or second grade when they struggle to see the board in class.

              <h5>What causes myopia in children?</h5>
              Although the exact reason why some children become nearsighted and others do not is not fully understood, it appears heredity is a 
              factor, but not the only one.In other words, if both parents are nearsighted, there is a greater risk their children will be nearsighted, 
              too. But you can't predict who will become nearsighted by simply looking at their family tree. Some researchers think focusing fatigue from 
              excessive reading or holding a book or digital screen too close to your eyes for extended periods can increase the risk for myopia in children. 
              But nobody knows for sure. The exact cause (or causes) of myopia may remain a mystery, but researchers recently have discovered something about the 
              progression of nearsightedness that is very interesting: regular glasses and contact lenses that have been prescribed for years to correct myopia may 
              actually increase the risk of myopia worsening throughout childhood! Many of these same researchers are investigating new lens designs to see if they 
              can develop eyeglasses or contact lenses that can halt or slow the progression of nearsightedness in children.

              <h5>Myopia Peaks At Adulthood</h5>
              <p>Although classified as a progressive condition, the growth stage of the eye is typically completed by early adulthood. This means the natural shape of the 
                eye is established and should not become more curved or elongated over time. Whatever degree of myopia an individual has at early adulthood should stay
                relatively stable, and changes in distance vision generally do not continue to progress. </p>
              <p>However, there are exceptions to this rule. Myopia can sometimes worsen in adulthood for many reasons, including:  </p>
              <ul><strong>
                  <li>Over-focus on close objects</li>
                  <li>Traumatic brain injury or eye trauma</li>
